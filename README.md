> **Discrete-time Kalman filter implementation for COVID-19 case estimation using real epidemiological data from the BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC).**

This project demonstrates the application of advanced signal processing and statistical estimation techniques to public health data analysis, showcasing how Kalman filters can effectively track disease progression and provide reliable predictions despite noisy measurement data.

## Project Overview

During the COVID-19 pandemic, accurate estimation and prediction of case numbers became crucial for public health decision-making. This project implements a discrete-time Kalman filter to address challenges in epidemiological data analysis, including:

- **Noisy measurements**: Daily case reports contain reporting delays and measurement uncertainties
- **State estimation**: Extracting true underlying infection trends from observed data
- **Real-time processing**: Updating estimates as new data becomes available
- **Uncertainty quantification**: Providing confidence intervals for predictions

## Key Features

- **Multiple Filter Variants**: Three different Kalman filter implementations with varying complexity
- **Real Data Integration**: Validated using actual COVID-19 data from BCCDC
- **Epidemiological Modeling**: Incorporates pandemic growth dynamics in state-space representation
- **Noise Reduction**: Effectively filters measurement noise from daily case reports
- **Trend Prediction**: Provides 7-14 day forecasts with confidence intervals
- **Interactive Analysis**: MATLAB Live Script for hands-on exploration

## Algorithm Components

### Core Implementation Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `kalmanFilter.m` | Basic discrete-time Kalman filter implementation |
| `kalmanFilter2.m` | Enhanced version with improved noise modeling |
| `kalmanFilter3.m` | Advanced variant with adaptive parameters |
| `panmodel.m` | Epidemiological growth model (exponential/logistic phases) |
| `resetVariables.m` | Variable initialization and parameter setup |

### Mathematical Framework

The discrete-time system is modeled as:

```matlab
x(k+1) = F*x(k) + w(k)    % State evolution
y(k) = H*x(k) + v(k)      % Measurement model
```

**Where:**
- `x(k)`: State vector (infection parameters)
- `F`: State transition matrix
- `H`: Measurement matrix  
- `w(k)`: Process noise (Q covariance)
- `v(k)`: Measurement noise (R covariance)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- MATLAB R2020a or later
- Signal Processing Toolbox (recommended)
- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox (recommended)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Junaidk11/simple_kalman_filter.git
   cd simple_kalman_filter
   ```

2. **Launch MATLAB** and navigate to the project directory

3. **Run the Live Script:**
   ```matlab
   open('simple_kalman_filter_livescript.mlx')
   ```

### Quick Start Example

```matlab
% Load COVID-19 data
data = readmatrix('bccdc_data.csv');
cases = data(:, 2);  % Daily case numbers

% Initialize filter parameters
resetVariables;

% Run basic Kalman filter
filtered_cases = kalmanFilter(cases);

% Plot results
plot(1:length(cases), cases, 'b-', 1:length(filtered_cases), filtered_cases, 'r-');
legend('Raw Data', 'Filtered Data');
title('COVID-19 Case Estimation using Kalman Filter');
```

## Results & Performance

The Kalman filter implementation demonstrates significant improvements over raw data analysis:

### Key Achievements

- **Noise Reduction**: Successfully filtered measurement noise from daily case reports
- **Trend Identification**: Accurately tracked underlying infection trends despite data irregularities  
- **Prediction Capability**: Provided reliable short-term forecasts with confidence intervals
- **Real-time Processing**: Efficient algorithm for processing new data points

### Validation Results

Using BCCDC data from early pandemic phases:
- Reduced mean squared error compared to simple moving averages
- Better capture of exponential growth phases
- Improved detection of trend changes and inflection points
- Robust performance across different noise levels
